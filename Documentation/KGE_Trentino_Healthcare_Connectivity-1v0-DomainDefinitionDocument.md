# Project domain
Our domain of interest is compromised of the intersection of two major domain: the healthcare one and the transportation one since we're interested on how to reach healthcare facilities through public transportation.
# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help patients and healthcare workers commute from and to different healthcare facilities in Trentino. We focus on public transport, such as busses and trains, as well as less conventional ways of travelling such as car sharing and taxis in order for our final users to save both time and money.
